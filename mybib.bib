	abstract = {Network Functions Virtualization ({NFV}) is one of the most profound paradigm shifts the networking industry has faced to date. Proven functions such as routing, policy, firewall, {DPI}, and many others will move from running on dedicated hardware appliances to running on unproven virtualized server platforms in the hope of achieving massive efficiencies.    While carriers agree on the need and vision for {NFV}, many are struggling to quantify the benefits, understand the practical migration steps, and measure success:  How should they go about replacing their current network architecture, moving from purpose-built physical devices to a virtualized, software-controlled scenario?  How will they know with certainty that the migration was successful and justifies their investment?   Does the virtualized solution deliver the performance, resiliency, security, elasticity, and quality of experience ({QoE}) needed to satisfy customers?  With network usage, user expectations, and competitive threats all on the rise, the risks to operators’ brands and bottom line are too great to leave {NFV} deployments to chance. Everything known becomes unknown again, and there are risks associated both with moving too fast, and not fast enough.  From beginning to end, targeted test strategies and methodologies are needed to accelerate and ensure the delivery of {NFV} solutions with guaranteed quality. Ixia solutions validate that the motivations for {NFV} are achievable prior to migration, and that the expected benefits are realized in the virtualized environment. We help operators understand when it makes sense to virtualize an aspect of the network and when it doesn’t, delivering clear insight into the migration process and its ultimate success.},

	abstract = {Software Defined Networking is revolutionizing the networking world. While the industry transitions to a software-centric architecture, a clear definition of Sdn remains murky at best. This book clarifies the current industry confusion about what Sdn is, why it's important, and most importantly the protocols and use cases that define Sdn. {OpenFlow} (Of) is a critical piece of the Sdn puzzle. While Sdn solutions exist that do not require Of, it is undeniable that Of helped spur the innovation in Sdn. The history of Of, its current and future status, and the associated use cases will be explained in detail in this book. Lastly, the book attempts to lay out Sdn deployments that are real and current today, and apply practicality to the vast world of Sdn architectures.},

	abstract = {Foundations of Modern Networking is a comprehensive, unified survey of modern networking technology and applications for today’s professionals, managers, and students. Dr. William Stallings offers clear and well-organized coverage of five key technologies that are transforming networks: Software-Defined Networks ({SDN}), Network Functions Virtualization ({NFV}), Quality of Experience ({QoE}), the Internet of Things ({IoT}), and cloudbased services.     Dr. Stallings reviews current network ecosystems and the challenges they face–from Big Data and mobility to security and complexity. Next, he offers complete, self-contained coverage of each new set of technologies: how they work, how they are architected, and how they can be applied to solve real problems. Dr. Stallings presents a chapter-length analysis of emerging security issues in modern networks. He concludes with an up-to date discussion of networking careers, including important recent changes in roles and skill requirements.     Coverage:         Elements of the modern networking ecosystem: technologies, architecture, services, and applications     Evolving requirements of current network environments     {SDN}: concepts, rationale, applications, and standards across data, control, and application planes     {OpenFlow}, {OpenDaylight}, and other key {SDN} technologies     Network functions virtualization: concepts, technology, applications, and software defined infrastructure     Ensuring customer Quality of Experience ({QoE}) with interactive video and multimedia network traffic     Cloud networking: services, deployment models, architecture, and linkages to {SDN} and {NFV}     {IoT} and fog computing in depth: key components of {IoT}-enabled devices, model architectures, and example implementations     Securing {SDN}, {NFV}, cloud, and {IoT} environments     Career preparation and ongoing education for tomorrow’s networking careers       Key Features:         Strong coverage of unifying principles and practical techniques     More than a hundred figures that clarify key concepts     Web support at williamstallings.com/Network/      {QR} codes throughout, linking to the website and other resources     Keyword/acronym lists, recommended readings, and glossary     Margin note definitions of key words throughout the text},
