	abstract = {We present in this paper an overview of current problems with the Internet from the architectural view point, and we identify and forecast trends for future developments. Our study includes perspectives from different stakeholders of the Internet as well as from the technological development point of view. We conclude that current and future requirements vary greatly between, and even within, different stakeholders, which implies that a successful future network architecture must provide maximum flexibility with a minimal set of "hard-wired" properties. In specific, a revised version of the {TCP}/{IP} layered architecture would only suffice to address some of the current issues, but would not provide a long term solution. We then show that an autonomic network architecture with a few simple architectural building blocks is enough to address a great deal of the requirements today and in the future},

	abstract = {Due to the lack of multicast services in the Internet, applications based on single-source, multiple-destination transfers such as video conferencing, {IP} radio, and {IPTV} must use unicast. This type of traffic exhibits high redundancy with temporal clustering of duplicated packets. The redundancy originates from multiple transfers of the same data chunk over the same link. We propose {CacheCast}, a link-layer caching mechanism that eliminates the redundant data transmissions using small caches on links. {CacheCast}'s underlying principles are simplicity and reliability. It is a fully distributed and incrementally deployable architecture. It consists of small caches on links that act independently and a server support that simplifies the link cache operation. Our analysis indicates that transfers of the same data to multiple destinations with {CacheCast} can achieve near-multicast efficiency in terms of consumed link bandwidth. The implementation of {CacheCast} proves its feasibility, efficiency, and the improvements of the server.},

	abstract = {Network Functions Virtualization ({NFV}) is one of the most profound paradigm shifts the networking industry has faced to date. Proven functions such as routing, policy, firewall, {DPI}, and many others will move from running on dedicated hardware appliances to running on unproven virtualized server platforms in the hope of achieving massive efficiencies.    While carriers agree on the need and vision for {NFV}, many are struggling to quantify the benefits, understand the practical migration steps, and measure success:  How should they go about replacing their current network architecture, moving from purpose-built physical devices to a virtualized, software-controlled scenario?  How will they know with certainty that the migration was successful and justifies their investment?   Does the virtualized solution deliver the performance, resiliency, security, elasticity, and quality of experience ({QoE}) needed to satisfy customers?  With network usage, user expectations, and competitive threats all on the rise, the risks to operators’ brands and bottom line are too great to leave {NFV} deployments to chance. Everything known becomes unknown again, and there are risks associated both with moving too fast, and not fast enough.  From beginning to end, targeted test strategies and methodologies are needed to accelerate and ensure the delivery of {NFV} solutions with guaranteed quality. Ixia solutions validate that the motivations for {NFV} are achievable prior to migration, and that the expected benefits are realized in the virtualized environment. We help operators understand when it makes sense to virtualize an aspect of the network and when it doesn’t, delivering clear insight into the migration process and its ultimate success.},
